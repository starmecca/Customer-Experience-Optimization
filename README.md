# Customer-Experience-Optimization
An independent case study inspired by my time as a Loweâ€™s associate, exploring how data analytics, QA, and API testing can enhance the customer experience for Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store (BOPIS) systems. This project is for personal learning and professional development, and is not affiliated with Loweâ€™s. 

# Improving the Lowe's BOPIS Experience
*A personal case study by Janet*

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To explore how data analytics, quality assurance, and API testing contribute to optimizing the customer experience in the Lowe's Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store (BOPIS) process.

## ðŸ§­ Background
As a former Loweâ€™s associate and an aspiring Product Manager, I observed the real-world challenges customers face during pickup. This project revisits that journey through the lens of product management.

## ðŸ§© Approach
1. Map the current customer journey.
2. Identify friction points through observation and mock data.
3. Use API testing and QA thinking to understand system dependencies.
4. Propose and prioritize improvements based on customer and business impact.

## ðŸ“Š Data & Analysis
*(My mock dataset or visualizations)*



## ðŸ§ª API Testing Insight
Key endpoints or mock requests relevant to the pickup flow (e.g., order status, inventory check, confirmation).



## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
A brief description of my improvement conceptâ€” (e.g. live pickup ETA tracking or digital queue notifications).



## âœ… QA & Testing Plan
High-level checklist of how Iâ€™d validate the new feature.
